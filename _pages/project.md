Elastoacoustic Wave Propagation in Biphasic Mechanical Metamaterial
======
We presents a high contrast mechanical metamaterial made of periodic solid cells with interconnected air-filled voids presents simultaneous acoustic and elastic frequency bandgaps in its dispersion spectrum, and can provide a valuable and tunable solution in terms of passive control of elasto-acoustic wave propagation. The sound and vibration insulation performances were verified by a finite element analysis of forced waves propagating through a finite-size metamaterial domain, which is composed by a finite array of repetitive cells and is representative of a real application. The behavior of the metamaterial was analyzed observing the transmission coefficients in both fluid and solid domains. The simulation results showed that the metamaterial effectively behaves as a multifunctional filter, by passively controlling the propagation of acoustic and elastic waves. It exhibits insulation properties with multi-band wave attenuation. Moreover, parametric analyses of the geometric and elastic properties of the periodic cell provided evidence of the design variables to further improve the filtering performance.

Design of Biphasic Metamaterials
======
In this work, we present a mechanical metamaterial, characterized by a biphasic (fluid and solid) periodic cell, that exhibits acoustic as well as elastic bandgaps in the dispersion spectrum, which – in principle – could provide insulation from both sound and vibration in prescribed frequency ranges. Bandgaps arise when voids and channels open in the repetitive cell. We aim at studying the geometric parameters that influence the metamaterial performance. Through a tuning of the mechanical properties of the metamaterial, waves of given nature and frequency can be remarkably attenuated simultaneously in the two different domains, the fluid domain where acoustic waves propagate and the solid domain where elastic waves propagate. A finite element model is used to determine the dispersion curves and investigate the frequency band structure, which is found to be governable through the selection of the geometric parameters of the repetitive cell.

Wave Mixing Technique
======
Wave mixing means when two internally resonant Lamb wave modes of different frequencies are allowed to mix within the material, which generates a third type of harmonic waves at frequencies. This resonance need synchronism condition on phase matching and non zero power flux. Finite element model was employed and showed that the amplitude of the secondary harmonics is sensitive to the state of prestress

Second harmonic generation in prestressed media
======
In this work, we studied the nonlinear guided wave propagation in prestressed Aluminum plates associated with the second harmonic generation by using 2 FE simulations. The model empoyed is a second-order approximation accounting for material and geometric nonlinearities. Three different states of prestress are considered, that are: uniaxial stress in the direction of the wave propagation (case A), uniaxial stress orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation (B), and plane state of stress in the plane of the plate (C).
